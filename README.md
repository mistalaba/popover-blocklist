# popover-blocklist
Simple list for uBlock (and perhaps Adblock) for blocking popovers

Why?
----
Recently there's been a boom in popovers on all kinds of sites. These popovers block what you're reading, usually even before you know what the site is about (so why on earth would you want to subscribe to their newsletter at that point???). 

My statistics shows that about 78% of all websites on the internet uses popovers and exactly 100% of these are annoying.

Usage
-----
Add https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mistalaba/popover-blocklist/master/blocklist.txt to your filter subscriptions if you want to block some popovers, like "Subscribe to our newsletter", "Like us on Facebook" etc.
